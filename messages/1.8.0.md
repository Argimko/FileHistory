v1.8.0 (2016-04-06)
-------------------

- Now properly handles situations where the to-be-previewed or -opened file
  already existed in another group (#23)
- Added new setting `reopen_file_in_current_group` to control this behavior
- The parameter for instantly opening the most recently closed file has changed
  (see README.md if you are affected)
- Fixed a bug where the panel closed the current file if all files in the panel
  were currently open (#34) (@lastsecondsave)
- Fixed various edge cases including races in the preview involving quick-
  opening or deleting the selected entry (@rahul-ramadas)
- Only quick-open the selected entry if the caret is at the end of text
- Don't print "reloading" message during initial load
- Don't clean anonymous projects on ST3 as long as they remain open
