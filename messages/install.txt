File History
============

**Sublime Text 2 and 3** plugin to provide access to the history of accessed files - project-wise or globally. Stores data in a JSON file. The most recently closed file can be instantly re-opened with a keyboard shortcut or the user can search through the entire file history within the quick panel (including file preview and the ability to open multiple files).  

For a changelog, see CHANGELOG.md.

Usage
-----

To use the plugin, open the Command Palette and search for `File History:`. You can see the default key bindings in the palette, or alternatively browse "Preferences > Package Settings > File History > Key Bindings - Default" in the menu.
