File History
============

A plugin to provide access to the history of accessed files - project-wise or globally. Stores a JSON file with the file history.
**Sublime Text 3 compatible**.

Obtained from [https://gist.github.com/1133602][gist] by Josh Bjornson.


**Note**: I tried checking for file existence in the history but this took more time than expected (especially with networked files) and made the plugin quite unresponsive. The compromise is a command to cleanup the current project (with the option to clean up the global list as well). The cleanup will remove any files in the project history that don't exist.

For a changelog, see `CHANGELOG.md`.

Usage
-----

To view the default keymap definitions, browse "Preferences > Package Settings > File History > Key Bindings - Default" in the menu.
