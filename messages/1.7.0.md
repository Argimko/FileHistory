v1.7.0 (2014-10-03)
-------------------

- Save timestamps in POSIX time instead of a user-specific string format; the
  format setting is now only used for displaying absolute timestamps in the
  panel (see #28)
- Remove doubled information in history file, namely 'action' key (#30)
- Fix a bug where quickly browsing through the reopen panel would cause some
  views to get mistaken for real views and added to the history (#31)
- Fix exception when timestamp could not be parsed (#28)
