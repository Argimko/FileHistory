v1.5.0 (2014-07-08)
-------------------

- [ST2] Added support for cleanup on startup for ST2
- [ST3] Added shortcut to delete the currently selected history entry
  *Note*: The entry will be deleted but will still be visible in the current
  quick panel.
  Mapped to "ctrl+delete" by default ("cmd+delete" on OSX).
- Added setting and command to reset/clear all history data (#14)
- Added option to display the timestamp of the history entry (either the last
  opened/closed or the filesystem's last modified timestamp), relative or
  absolute
- When cleaning up, do not consider just current project and global (#15)
- The history file is now "minimized" by default. You can adjust the settings
  if you want it prettified. (#15)
- Improved plugin responsiveness by opening the preview in the background
  (noticable with large or remote files)
- Fixed quick panel shortcuts not working with previewing disabled (#19)
- Update Menu entries (#21)
